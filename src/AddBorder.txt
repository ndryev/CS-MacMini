Steps:
1. find out length of each string
2. create a set of asterisks that match that length
3. add first set of asterisks to String array
4. add each word in picture prefixed/suffixed with "*"
5. add another set of asterisks

String array is equal to the length of the picture array + 2 (two sets of ast)
